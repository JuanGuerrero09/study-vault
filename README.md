A repo for study questions and exam preparation

Initially it works for the winter semester of the TU Dresden Msc Hydro Science and Engineering topics.

Data currently in:

- Climatology (Class 8) (+ quiz + exercises)
- Hydrology (Class 8)
- Hydrochemistry (Class )

If the questions are provided by educator (in class quiz or opal exercises) or are from an old exam then the question bank assumes it as exam question.
