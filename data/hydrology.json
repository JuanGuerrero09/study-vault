    "answer": "BHQ1 is the design flood used for sizing spillways and overflow structures. BHQ2 is an extreme safety verification flood used to ensure global dam stability during catastrophic events.",

    "question": "Why is PMP used for BHQ2 stability checks instead of standard return periods?",
    "answer": "PMP represents the physical upper limit of precipitation possible at a location. It is used for stability checks because it provides a safety margin beyond statistical probability for high-risk infrastructure.",

    "answer": "Urban drainage systems are designed based on peak discharge (flow rate). IDF provides rainfall intensity (mm/hr), which directly correlates to peak flow, whereas DDF provides total accumulated depth.",

    "answer": "u (location) represents the mode or 'typical' annual maximum. alpha (scale) represents the variability or spread; a higher alpha indicates a greater difference between small and large return period events.",
