    "question": "Why does mixing two equal volumes of acid and base buffer components change the concentrations used in the HH equation?",
    "answer": "Mixing increases the total volume of the solution. Since concentration = moles / volume, increasing the volume decreases the concentration of each species, though the ratio [Base]/[Acid] remains the same.",
